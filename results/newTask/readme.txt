Type of controller: Feedforward plus PI
Feedback gains: P = 1, I = 0.01
The end of the first trajectory segment corresponds to the timestep 1614, so you can see on the plot the error is eliminated before that.

Initial cube configuration (x, y, theta): 0, -0.5, 0
Final desired cube configuration (x, y, theta): 0, 1, pi/2

Initial configuration of the end-effector has 0.5 meter offset by Y axis and -0.7 rad in arm joint #3 which is 40 degrees along Y axis
